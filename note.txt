ep9 - 
  used proj (IdentityServer, ApiOne, ApiTwo)
  in this episode, IdentityServer is used for OAuth & OIDC. ApiOne is created as an API, and ApiTwo is created to act
  as a client API calling ApiOne using the token created using ClientCredential. ApiTwo is registered in IdentityServer as
  a Client that has access to scope ApiOne. In ApiTwo/Home/Index, it first creates
  httpClient and calls the IdentityServer to get the token using Client Credential flow
  then it calls the ApiOne/secret [Authorize] with this token added to the header
  For ApiOne, in the ConfigureServices, it tells, it is authenticating from the IdentityServer using Bearer token (oidc)
  therefore, any [Authorize] method in ApiOne must have a token dealt out from IdentityServer with scope (ApiOne)
ep10 -
  used proj (IdentityServer, MvcClient)
  in this episode, it just prepares and create MvcClient to use authorization-code flow for openID connect for ep11
ep11 - 
  used proj (IdentitiyServer, MvcClient)
  in this episode, log-in and register page is created. So MVC Client page home/secret [Authorize] is first accessed, 
  it will be automatically directed to IdentityServer's login page (since the authorization-code flow is used)
  If the user is successfully registered or logged-in, it user is authenticated and will be re-directed to 
  mvcClient/home/secret page
